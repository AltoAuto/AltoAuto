# Hi, I'm Aiden Wang

Founder of **AltoAuto** â€” a student-led engineering automation suite built for the real workflows engineers deal with.  
We eliminate the boring stuff in CAD and FEA so you can focus on actually building.

## Philosophy

> Build tools that work even when the system doesn't.

Not chasing perfection.  
Chasing results, speed, and clarity.  
Engineering should feel like momentum, not manual labor.

*Currently based in the U.S.  
Looking to collaborate with student builders, small engineering teams, and people who hate slow workflows as much as I do.*
