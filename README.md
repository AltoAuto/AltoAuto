# 👋 Hi, I’m @AltoAuto

🚀 Building automation tools for engineers who are tired of wasting time on CAD/FEA busywork.  
🎯 Founded AltoAuto — a student-led project that turns engineering pain into clean, powerful tools.

---

## 👀 I’m interested in:
- CAD automation (SolidWorks API, macros, win32com, etc.)
- FEA scripting (MAPDL, PyMAPDL, simulation pipelines)
- Real-world engineering workflows — and how to fix them
- Building tools students and small teams can actually use

---

## 🌱 Currently working on:
- AltoAuto BOM Generator v1.0 (Smart Excel output, recursive assembly scanning)
- Phase 1 of FEA Assistant (automated setup + DXF face extraction)
- A licensing + update system for tool delivery via Wix + Python backend

---

## 🤝 Let’s collaborate if:
- You're into engineering automation, and hate manual workflows as much as we do
- You’ve built custom macros or scripts for your team, but want to take it further
- You want to test AltoAuto tools or build new ones with us

## ⚡ Fun fact:
AltoAuto started as a one-week hack to help a student team — now it’s grown into a full suite used by clubs, freelancers, and researchers.
